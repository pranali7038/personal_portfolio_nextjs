## My Journey to Infosys as a Specialist Programmer

Getting selected as a Specialist Programmer at Infosys has been one of the most exciting milestones in my journey so far. It wasn’t something that happened overnight — it took consistent effort, smart planning, and a lot of learning.

### Step 1: Understanding the Role

Before diving into preparation, I made sure I clearly understood what the Specialist Programmer (SP) role actually meant. Infosys designed this role for candidates with strong problem-solving skills and a good grasp of system-level thinking. It’s much more coding-intensive than their System Engineer or Digital roles — and that motivated me even more.

### Step 2: How I Prepared

My preparation was mostly self-driven. Here’s what helped me the most:

- I dedicated time daily to practice **Data Structures & Algorithms**, especially on platforms like **LeetCode** and **GeeksforGeeks**.
- I revised **core CS concepts** such as **DBMS**, **Operating Systems**, **OOPs**, and **Computer Networks**.
- I worked on a few personal projects and made sure I could clearly explain the tech stack, architecture, and challenges during interviews.
- I also explored topics like **Spring Boot**, **React**, and **Machine Learning**, since Infosys values modern tech awareness.

### Step 3: Infosys Hiring Rounds

The selection process had 3 rounds:

- 🧠 **Online Coding Test** – It included 3 medium-to-hard DSA problems, time-bound (about 180 minutes). Strong logic building is key here.
- 💬 **Technical Interview** – They focused a lot on DSA, my final-year/project work, and real-life problem-solving. I was also asked questions from DBMS and OOPs.
- 🙋‍♀️ **HR Round** – This was mostly behavioral — they checked my communication skills, thought process, and adaptability.

### Step 4: Key Takeaways

- Consistency matters more than intensity.
- Don’t just prepare to "clear" the test — understand what you're learning.
- Mock interviews help a lot. Even practicing with friends boosts confidence.

I hope this post helps someone on a similar path. If you’re preparing for Infosys SP, keep going — your efforts will pay off ✨

## My Daily Routine as a Developer & Fresher 👩‍💻

Starting my journey as a fresher in the tech industry has been exciting, and building a daily routine helped me stay productive, balanced, and always learning.

### 🕗 8:00 AM — Morning Kickstart

I start my day with a short walk or some light stretches. A fresh mind always helps with debugging 😄  
Followed by breakfast and checking emails or Slack updates.

### 💻 9:30 AM — Work Begins

My work usually starts with:

- Reviewing my **task board**
- Picking up a ticket or feature
- Reading documentation or debugging existing issues

I try to maintain a balance between **writing code** and **understanding why I’m writing it**.

### ☕ 1:00 PM — Lunch Break

A proper break to reset my brain — sometimes I catch a quick YouTube video or read tech blogs.

### 🔁 2:00 PM — Afternoon Focus

- Continue with feature development
- Push commits and raise PRs
- Peer reviews & discussion with my mentor or lead

This part of the day is my most productive — I usually avoid meetings here.

### 🌱 5:30 PM — Learning Time

Even after work, I dedicate an hour to **learning**:

- DSA practice (LeetCode/GeeksforGeeks)
- Working on side projects or my portfolio
- Exploring topics like AI/ML, Spring Boot, etc.

### 🌙 8:00 PM — Wind Down

Dinner + family time. I sometimes journal progress or update my Notion board.  
Sleep by 11:30 PM (after binge-watching something occasionally! 😄)

### 💡 Final Thoughts

Routines aren’t meant to be perfect — they’re meant to **guide you**.  
Having structure has helped me stay consistent, learn faster, and feel less overwhelmed as a fresher in tech.  
If you're just starting out, don’t copy someone else’s schedule — **build what works for you** ✨

## Balancing College, Internships & Side Projects: My Strategy

Being a final-year engineering student, managing college submissions, internships, and side projects was no less than a juggling act. But over time, I figured out a system that kept me productive — without burning out.

### 🎓 College Comes First

Academics were my base. I made sure to:

- Attend the core lectures and labs I couldn’t afford to skip.
- Finish assignments early to avoid last-minute pressure.
- Schedule study time during weekends or lighter weekdays.

### 💼 Internships for Real-World Exposure

My internship was hybrid, so I allocated fixed hours (e.g., 2–5 PM daily). Here’s how I handled it:

- Treated it like a part-time job — no distractions.
- Took notes of real issues I solved — they helped during interviews.
- Communicated clearly with mentors about college exam dates.

### 💡 Side Projects: My Learning Playground

Working on React and full-stack apps taught me more than lectures ever could. I handled it like this:

- Blocked 1–2 hours post-dinner (when I was mentally relaxed).
- Worked on tasks I could finish in 30–60 mins — to avoid frustration.
- Used weekends for bigger features or deployment tasks.

### 🧠 What Helped Me Stay Sane

- **Trello** and **Notion** for task tracking.
- A simple morning routine to plan my top 3 tasks for the day.
- Breaks! Walks, music, even 20-minute naps.

Balancing all three isn’t about doing everything every day — it’s about consistency, smart prioritization, and taking care of your energy.

Hope this helps you build your own routine too! 🚀

## How I Prepared for DSA: My Personal Strategy

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) was something I struggled with initially. It seemed abstract and hard to apply. But over time, I built a system that worked — and eventually cracked coding rounds for placements.

Here’s my exact journey 👇

### 💡 Step 1: Get the Basics Right

I started with understanding:

- What DSA is and **why** it’s important.
- Focused on **arrays, strings, recursion** first — no rush.
- Watched simple YouTube playlists (like CodeWithHarry or Apna College) for visual clarity.

### ✍️ Step 2: Maintain Notes & Track Patterns

Every time I solved a question, I noted:

- Problem type (e.g., sliding window, two-pointer, etc.)
- Logic or edge case I struggled with
- A simpler version of the code if needed

### 🛠️ Step 3: Practice Platforms

I used a tiered approach:

- **Beginner**: GeeksForGeeks (Topic-wise)
- **Intermediate**: LeetCode Easy → Medium problems
- **Advanced**: Some CP-style questions from Codeforces

### 🧠 Step 4: Strengthen Core Concepts

I revised:

- **Recursion vs Iteration**
- **Sorting algorithms**
- **Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees**

### 🗓️ Daily Practice Plan (My Routine)

- 🕓 1–1.5 hours daily (consistently, even on busy days)
- 1 new problem + 1 revision problem
- Weekend: Mock coding test or timed contest

DSA takes time. But it becomes addictive once you crack a few good questions. Stick with it — the results are worth it! 🔥

## How I Stay Confident Without Comparing Myself to Others

Let’s be honest — when we see a friend getting a dream job, winning an award, or achieving something big, it’s *hard* not to compare. I've been there too.

### 🎯 Step 1: Accept That It’s Natural

Comparison is human. It’s okay to feel it — but what matters is what you do next.

### 🧭 Step 2: Define *Your* Version of Success

Your journey is unique. Your goals, values, background, and pace — none of that is the same as someone else's.

### 📵 Step 3: Reduce Passive Scrolling

Social media shows you everyone’s highlights — not their struggles. I’ve limited mindless scrolling and replaced it with time reflecting on my small wins.

### 🧘‍♀️ Step 4: Practice Self-Check-ins

I often ask:

- What made me smile this week?
- Did I do something that scared me?
- Am I learning something meaningful?

Focus on progress, not perfection. Celebrate your path. You’re doing better than you think 🌿
